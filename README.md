# Tic-tac-toe web app
with AI payer using minimax algorithm and time controll in form of `undo` and `redo` buttons <br>

developed based on the tic-tac-toe [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) 

## Minimax algorithm
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) used to **mini**mize **max**imum possible loss. In case of tic-tac-toe the algorithm can viably go through the entire game tree and select an optimal move. <br> The app has more of an educational purpose as the player cannot win against the opponent that uses this algorithm.
